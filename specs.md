Final Learning Record Store (LRS) Specification
Introduction
This specification outlines the technical and functional requirements for the development of a Learning Record Store (LRS), designed to collect, validate, and store xAPI statements. This LRS will be a part of a larger ecosystem featuring Kong Gateway for scalability and Metabase for analytics, among other tools.

Core Requirements
Compliance and Standards
Must adhere to xAPI (Experience API) 2.0 specifications for the handling of learning records.

Statement Validation
Must validate incoming xAPI statements against the xAPI specification.
Must respond with appropriate xAPI compliant error codes for invalid statements.

Data Integrity
Should ensure that only complete and validated xAPI statements are inserted into MongoDB.
Any preprocessing or transformation of data must maintain its integrity as per the xAPI specification.

Data Storage
Must store all validated xAPI statements in MongoDB.
Data structure in MongoDB should facilitate efficient queries and should be designed with Metabase analytics in mind.

Error Handling
Must catch and log exceptions and errors adequately, providing meaningful error messages.
User Authentication and Authorization
Must integrate with Kong Gateway for handling Authentication and Authorization.
Must support Basic Authentication as a minimum with the possibility of integrating OAuth2 in the future.
API Endpoints
Must provide an HTTP POST endpoint at /xapi/statements for xAPI statements ingestion.
Additional Requirements

Scalability
Must be designed with scalability in mind, leveraging Kong Gateway's features for load balancing, rate-limiting, etc.

Security
Must implement secure coding practices.
Must allow secure HTTPS connections.
Must sanitize all incoming data to prevent injection attacks.

Analytics
Data structure and storage must be optimized for analytics via Metabase.
Should consider an easy export feature for data analytics and visualization in Metabase.

User Roles and Personas
Data Integrity Officers: Focused on xAPI compliance and data validation.
System Administrators: Responsible for system integrity, scalability, and security.
Developers: Responsible for maintaining and upgrading the LRS.
Compliance Officers: Ensuring full compliance with legal regulations and xAPI specifications.
Optional Requirements

Rate Limiting
Can rely on Kong Gateway for rate-limiting.
Logging and Monitoring
Should integrate with Kong's logging plugins for system monitoring and alerts.
Billing and Access Control
Should consider a future module for paid access to the LRS.
Future Enhancements

Real-time analytics.
Additional endpoints for more complex queries.
Integration with additional third-party services.
By adhering to this specification, the LRS will become a robust, secure, and scalable service within the organization's educational tech stack. It will focus primarily on its core responsibility of validating and storing xAPI statements while relying on other specialized services for added functionality, thereby ensuring a modular and maintainable architecture.
