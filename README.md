# xDB: Experience Layer of the Modern Internet

## Overview

xDB aims to be the **Experience Layer of the Modern Internet**. Our mission is to track, analyze, and monetize experiences across all touchpoints—both online and offline. This repository focuses specifically on xDB's validation layer, a critical component that ensures high-quality, reliable data for driving unparalleled business growth.

## Features

- **Robust Validation**: Ensure that the data meets the prescribed standards and specifications.
- **Scalable**: Designed to handle high volumes of data without compromise.
- **Extensible**: Modular architecture allows for additional features and capabilities to be added seamlessly.

## Installation

\```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/xDB.git
cd xDB
npm install
